# Battleship
A vanilla JS Battleship app that supports 1- and 2-player modes. 

The purpose of this app was to apply test-driven development principles to a more significant application. The most significant difficulties however were in the form of developing a 'smart' algorithm for the computer to adopt, as well as finding a smooth drag-and-drop style for placing ships on the board.
